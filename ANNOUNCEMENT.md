# Hello \<insert community name here\>

We're excited to announce our "latest" project, Dungeon Utils!<br>
This Zelda based mod for fabric 1.20.1 (Boko, if you want it ported to 1.21, port it your freaking self :P) will aim to add Zelda-based features to Minecraft, as well as allowing for map makers to utilize some awesome features like Hylian fonts, Zelda based blocks and items, Dungeon-like mechanics (like the switch blocks, which were the whole reason this project even started xD), and more!<br>
Dungeon Utils is still in development, meaning it may be a while before a 100% working version is released to the public, however, we look forward to announcing updates and hope to have a full release for the public as soon as possible, whilst still maintaining quality standards about the work within.<br>
If you have any questions related to the mod, please contact @ideallykafei, or @epicvon2468 and you should receive a response relatively quickly.<br>
(And yes if you want you can offer advice about implementation of certain features, or mention stuff you'd like to see in the mod.)<br>
Wishing you all well,<br>
