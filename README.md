# Dungeon Utils

### What is Dungeon Utils?<br>
Dungeon Utils is an experimental mod for Minecraft based on The Legend Of Zelda.

Although currently in beta, more features and functionality will be added soon.
Keep in mind that not everything implemented works fully, or has been tested outside of dev environment properly.

Currently working features include:
- Bombs
- Crate (but I haven't made it work without /summon, will fix that soon)
- The Master Sword (and variations)
- All swords
- Multishot bows
- Revali's Gale
- Mipha's Grace
- Heart Containers
- Most of the Masks (I think a few still need to be added or have features implemented)
- All switch blocks
